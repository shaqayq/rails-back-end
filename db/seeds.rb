# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
   greeting = Greeting.create([{ message: "Star Wars" }, { message: "Lord of the Rings" } ,{ message: "Helloworld" }, { message: "By world" }])
#   Character.create(name: "Luke", movie: movies.first)
